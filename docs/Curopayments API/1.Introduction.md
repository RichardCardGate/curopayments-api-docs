# Introduction

The API is implemented as JSON or XML over HTTPS protocol using all four verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Each resource, like Transaction, Customer or iDEAL, has its own URL and is manipulated in isolation. In other words we've tried to make API follow the REST principles as much as possible.

This API is intended to be used by merchants in their own web shop or on-line services to fully integrate the solutions offered by CURO.

Like all software and websites, this is always a work in progress which is never finished. If you would like to propose new functionality or add new features, feel free to contact us at support@curopayments.net.
